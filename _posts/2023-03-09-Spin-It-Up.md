# Spin-It-Up

## Where we play

Workspace is important to getting things done. Here's how I do it:

[Hardware Host: Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) Consolidate wherever possible. Having a single box that can host multiple machines keeps things in one place and easier to manage.

[Virtual machine running Ubuntu Kinetic 22.10](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-release-notes/27976) I aim for the latest and greatest when possible.

[Running Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) Of course, consolidation means keeping things Lean. Deployment sources should be the same, using this tooling helps facilitate uniformity.

This may not be the optimized setup but it is mine. My near goal is to simplify the learning environment, ideally containerize all of it.

## What we play

Latest update, finished the learning paths I had planned out for Scrum & Site Reliability Engineering. Next up on my study is more code, <https://learn.microsoft.com> for ASP.NET Core & <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2> for NodeJS. Lots more to learn after this.
