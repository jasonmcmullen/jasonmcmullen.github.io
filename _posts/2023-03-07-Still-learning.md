# Still-Learning
This is a great opportunity to sync up with what's going on and set some goals.

100% cut over to using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) in all my projects. Not only is it a great tool, it has a very active & supportive community backing it.

My study focus has been split, still on the technical side but now also appending new ways of looking at problem solving. I've been up to my ears in Agile, Lean & Scrum methodologies. It's been a year and I've learned a lot. tl;dr work smarter not harder. Interested? here's the tip of the iceberg: [ScrumGuides.org](https://scrumguides.org)

In addition to this I've been focusing on bringing more value to what I see being a Site Reliability Engineer & being involved in DevOps. Great learning resource on DevOps I recently found is [MarcelDempers.dev](https://marceldempers.dev)

Goals going forward: Atomate wherever possible, remove toil. Containerize everything & spend the time to write HelloWorld projects to understand new tech & journal the learning path on GitHub. Code is fun but setup and sync can be problematic. Using the tools to make the job easier is a great way to address this. Keep the environments simple and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) ensures the sync is uniform. Mr. Dempers does a wonderful job of explaining what/why/when these tools can be used.

- Keep moving forward
