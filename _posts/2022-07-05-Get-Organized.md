# GET ORGANIZED!
We're back, with more fun to be had! Today's focus is sorting everything. 
I've read once that an organized space helps an organized mind, not sure if it's true but I'll take a whack at it.

1. **Hardware:** 

So far, my <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/cty/poweredge-2420-rack-enclosure/spd/poweredge-2420">Dell PowerEdge 2420 24U rack</a> is perfect for my needs. Scored a great deal on it when an office in my area was upgrading.

Within this I've built up 2x <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/black-rosewill-rsv-r4000/p/N82E16811147154?Item=N82E16811147154">Rosewill RSV-R4000 4U cases</a>, populated by my <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> type-1 hypervisors (used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machines</a> & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)">Containers</a>).

2. **Storage:** 

<a href="https://www.newegg.ca/synology-ds918/p/N82E16822108682">DS918+</a>, this is soon to change, more on this later.

3. **Networking:** 

Mainly run through my ISP issued HomeHub3000 and routed through various cheap switches around the house, this too is soon to change. As well, I've got a WS-C3560-24PS-S switch, still works but doesn't meet my needs anymore. 

4. **Power:** 

 Managed by a <a href="https://www.newegg.ca/startech-rkpw081915-pdu/p/N82E16816129051?Item=9SIA7BB2JK5360">StarTech RKPW081915 Power Distribution Unit(PDU)</a> (surge protected, yuck! I now...) and a separate <a href="https://www.apc.com/ca/en/product/BN1500M2-CA/apc-backups-pro-1500va-120v-avr-lcd-2-usb-charging-ports-10-nema-outlets-4-surge/">APC 1500VA UPS</a> for the system critical stuff.
**Note**: NEVER plug a PSU into a surge protected PDU, they cancel out protection. There's discussion on the topic but my view is simply don't do it.

## The Plan?

Currently I'm using this setup to learn all I can about cloud compute without breaking production environments, spinning up, stressing out and intentionally breaking labs to see how things tick.

I'd very much like to upgrade to some dedicated used enterprise gear for my hypervisors, not consumer desktop hardware but rather ECC memory, proper storage, managed networking and better power management. This is still in planning phase but will write down all I commit here.


By no means is this the perfect setup, but it's mine and I like it.
